Stata codes for benefit calculation and Excel files for both cost and benefit calculation

The "**Do file**" has the Stata codes that were used to clean the data from the facility exit survey which were used to calculate the benefits. 
The do file has two parts: 1. Codes for data cleaning and processing 2. Codes for data analysis
These codes are applied upon the Excel File titled, "**Facility-based Survey dataset**", that contains the survey data.
Applying these codes, we got the benefit estimates that were used in the tables of 'direct cost savings', 'intangible cost savings', 'provider-side cost savings' and 'indirect cost savings'.

**Voucher** file contains the costs of screening ingrdients at the upazila and union level. These vouchers were one of the data sources for implementatoon costs calculation.
