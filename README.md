Stata codes for benefit calculation and Excel files for both cost and benefit calculation

The file titled "**Benefit of Screening**" contains all the benefit calculation tables that were provided in the manuscript and the supplementary appendix. 
The file has 8 worksheet. 
The first worksheet is given as a cover page and the subsequent four worksheets are for direct, indirect, intangible and provider-side cost savings (benefits) respectively.
The fifth worksheet contains the calculations that show how the future incomes were discounted while estimating indirect cost savings from early cancer detection.
The sixth and seventh worksheets contain the calculation of annual societal cost savings and annual national cost savings respectively. 
The last worksheet has the tables showing sensitivity analyses.
There exists a few tables in this file which were not included neither in the manuscript nor the supplementary appendix.
There are a few notes and assumptions mentioned 'again' in some worksheets for convenience of understanding and clarity.

The file titled "**Cost of Screening**" contains all the cost side data and estimation tables.
The first page works as a cover page
The second worksheet contains all the union level data and calculation tables. The name of the cost items and the amount required per community clinic and union directly come from the Nawly Pilot Project titled "An Organized Community-Based Clinical Screening Program for Cervical, Breast, and Oral Cancer in Bangladesh: Design and Pilot Experiment". Data on unit price also have the same source, with a few exceptions.
The third worksheet contains the data and calculation tables for upazila level cost calculation. The data have the same source as union.
The fourth worksheet shows total rural level annual cost i.e., union plus upazilla in Bangaldesh
Sheet 5 shows the estimaton of screening spots to cover whole urban area in Bangaldesh and the subsequent costs.
Sheet 6 shows the annual cost of testing at the tertiary level facilities.
Sheet 7 has the table showing national level yearly cost calculations. 
Lastly, sheet 8 shows the benfit-cost ratio, the actual one (in italic) and also for hypothetical scenarios.
There are some notes in some worksheets which are used for clarity.

The "**Do File**" has the codes that were used to clean the data from the facility exit survey which were used to calculate the benefits. 
The do file has two parts: 1. Codes for data cleaning and processing 2. Codes for data analysis
These codes are applied upon the Excel File titled, "**UGC cencer study dataset**", that contains the survey data.
Applying these codes, we got the benefit estimates that were used in the tables of 'direct cost savings', 'intangible cost savings', 'provider-side cost savings' and 'indirect cost savings'.
